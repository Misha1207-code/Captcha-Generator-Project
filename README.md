**About the Project**
The Enhanced CAPTCHA Generator is a web-based security tool that helps verify if a user is human by generating a random CAPTCHA code that must be entered correctly. It prevents bots from accessing websites and includes features like:
Automatic CAPTCHA refresh after incorrect attempts
Case sensitivity toggle for added security
Dark mode for better user experience
Modern and responsive design

**Technologies Used**
1. HTML (Structure)
2. CSS (Styling & Dark Mode)
3. JavaScript (CAPTCHA Logic & Validation)

**How It Works**
A random CAPTCHA is generated and displayed on a canvas.
Users enter the CAPTCHA in the input field.
If correct, a success message appears; otherwise, a new CAPTCHA is generated.
Users can refresh the CAPTCHA, toggle case sensitivity, or switch to dark mode.
